        Me and my friend have been working on a comic book for about 5 years. Researching, editing and refining some of the comic book (The hidden lie).
        Half of the art work was made via original character made from me and my friend. The comic book has its debut in March 2020.
        At first, our comic book was not all about hero’s or as I like calling it the “unhinge” comic. It was all inspired via the creepypastas.
        We would created a scenario with our original characters and then "test out the plot", but sometimes we would lose the plot and instead of creating, on something else.
        Either found something unhinged and we wanted to see if it fits with in the comic or we found something funny and we wanted to use it with in the comic. 
       It was in March 2021, when we wanted to create a new proper story for the comic. The main two characters were a 15/16 year old boy named Erick and an 18/19  year old boy named Tobias. These two boys are cousins. One of them is a villein and the other is a hero. 
        The inspiration of this comic was from my hero academia and JJK. The comic plot line is that the hero Erick is missing something in his life, like his  other members in the family,  their "super hero buddy’s" side kicks. But he doesn’t have anyone, he only has himself . He wants to figure out who his sidekick is? (He’s the side kick mostly because Tobias is the alpha basically meaning he meant to be the hole leader and everything not Erick), Later on in the comic they would realise that they kind of have to work with each other. 
        There is another comic in mind, but I'm working on it. It's called (The looming rabbits). There are this group of students from a high school called Snapdragon high. The looming rabbits was made as a project for school.
        The characters came from a mixture of  well loved singers dead or alive and plush rabbits/ statues. All the rabbits have one thing in common that’s the school trauma.
        The members of LR are called Easter, Aaron (Ned), Springtrap, Sprinkles, Pink, Bonbon, Rusty, Sigwinnie, Cole and Pumpkin.
        They all have different genres of music being Glenrock, pop, country, k-pop/ j-pop, pop rock, heavy rock, jazz, etc. 
        The story still have to be developed.
